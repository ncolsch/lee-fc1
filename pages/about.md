## About the Collection
This site is a collection of digital images scanned from original photos featuring Lee Francis Colsch who lived in northeast Iowa from 1955 to 2022. This group of images was curated and described by Lee's younger sister, Nichole Colsch, as a project completed in partial fulfillment of a class on information organization. Nichole sought to collect a range of photos that would commemorate her brother in his various roles as son, brother, uncle, and friend. The range of images included were selected both to illustrate the span of Lee's life, from birth to near the time of his death, and to illuminate Lee's capacity for joy, thoughtfulness, intellect, and reflection. These images were selected from a much larger collection of family photos from various origins, originally scanned and digitized by Cheryl Colsch Forest.

This site is generated using [CollectionBuilder-GH](https://collectionbuilding.github.io/gh/), a project to create a free and simple digital collection using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) from: 

- a CSV of collection metadata
- a folder of JPG images or PDF documents

The template repository features four objects from the University of Idaho Library's [Digital Collections](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital).
